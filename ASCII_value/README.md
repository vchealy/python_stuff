# Changing Characters to ASCII values

I found a small script that changed one character into an ascii value.
Expanding on this to use a list, itterate against the list to make the changes.

Whilst printing out the list of ASCI values, to console, a list is being created of these values.
Itterate against the values to convert then back into characters.

Whilst printing out the list of characters a new list is created of these characters.
This is compared to the original list by calling a function that will pass or fail this 
comparison.
