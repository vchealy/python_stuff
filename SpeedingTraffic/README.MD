This is my idea for the future of speed cameras.

Prior to the camera there is a speed detection. If this is faster than the speed limit.
There  will be an illuminated line showing the discrepancy between the actual speed and the 
maximum allowed. Giving the driver a visual aid to understand their error.
This line could continue until through the camera trap, giving evidence of the
spped initially travelling at if they continued to speed by the camera trap.
A further enhancement could be detectors between the initial dectector and the camera
to reassess the driver speed
